It includes and analysis and a valuation of the company. The stock traded at around 50€ when the analysis was published in the university. It was then taken over by the management at around 70€, +40% in a few weeks.
# Axon_LH
- This investment case was NOT MADE BY ME. Thanks to my previous analysis I got the chance to do my Master's final project as an analyst at Lighthouse. I am currently doing the analysis of a Spanish REIT for them under their procedures, it will be published under their name later this year (2025).
- This analysis is uploaded here to show the type of analysis that I am doing, completely professional.
